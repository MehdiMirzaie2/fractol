# :sparkles: What is this Repo?

Fract_ol was a unique programming project that introduced me to a different programming concept than what I was accustomed to. It was an individual project that allowed me to explore rendering using a basic graphics (MINILIBX).

To successfully complete the project, I implemented three different fractals. Two of them, the Mandelbrot set and Julia set, were mandatory requirements. Additionally, I chose to implement the Newton fractal as my third fractal.

By undertaking this project, I gained valuable experience in rendering and expanded my knowledge of working with fractals.
